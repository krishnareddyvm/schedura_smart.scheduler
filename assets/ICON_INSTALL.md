Place the project icon file (provided as an attachment) into this assets/ folder and name it one of the following (in order of preference):

- `schedura_icon.png`
- `icon.png`
- `favicon.png`

Streamlit will automatically use the first existing file when starting the app (see `app.py`).

How to install the icon:

1. Save the attached image into `assets/schedura_icon.png`.
2. Start the Streamlit app from the project root:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

If Streamlit is already running, restart it to pick up the new favicon.
